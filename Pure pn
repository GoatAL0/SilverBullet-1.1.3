# SilverBullet 1.1.3


OpenBullet is a web testing suite that allows performing requests towards a target web app and offers many tools to work with the results. This software can be used for scraping and parsing data, automated pentesting, and unit testing through Selenium.

IMPORTANT! Performing (D)DoS attacks or credential stuffing on sites you do not own (or you do not have permission to test) is illegal! The developer will not be held responsible for the improper use of this software.
